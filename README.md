a 3d printed gearbox for hpa 

Features that is improved on this project are

can be used on traditional m4 receivers, and for competition uppers
can be used by modifying the gearbox or using a fully printed ones
can be used on any engine

at the first the main problem is finding the stabilization of the engine inside the upper housing, it can be aproached on many solutions,

first solution is by making a clamping mechanism on the upper housing, its a great approach and very simple to use, but has some downsides, normaly by the caracteristics of thermoplastics a constant movement of the piece can make a fadige stress on the overal structure, but it can be solved by ajusting the scructure to make it suitable for a repeat process of the clamping mechanism, another downside is that it requires more space to sit the upper part of the gearbox, since it needs something to make pressure on the piece, using bolts and nuts can use unecessary space and be quite challenging to make it efficient, heres is an idea of using a clamping mchanism to the gearbox approach;
